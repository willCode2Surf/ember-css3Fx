# EMBER CSS3 FX

This is the initial seed of a project that I am using to showcase some simple CSS3 features that can easily be applied to an ember view.  

## What's implemented so far?
* Various CSS3 effects and transformations


## Mixins
* NONE at this time but the next commit will see the addition of a FX mixin that will reduce all this code to a clean view, mixin, and some fixutre samples using the ember data fixture data adapter.
